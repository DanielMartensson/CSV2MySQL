# CSV2MySQL

This is a tool that can be used if you need to schedule a task that download CSV files from an FTP server, then import then delete these files on the FTP server. Then read the downloaded CSV files and import these into a MySQL/MariaDB database. Then delete these CSV files as well. 

Just open the project and go to the .properties files and set your configuration.
I have been used this for lots of projects when it comes to CodeSys logging. 

This tool is using the awesome Spring Framework.
